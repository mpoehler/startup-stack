# add Firestore

To show the interaction with Firestore, we let users edit a textfield in the firestore. All users using the same Textfield.

In this branch we create a new View that displays a value from the firestore and let the user change that value, too. 

For that we create a new module 'firestore' in the vuex and 
synchronize its state to the firestore.
